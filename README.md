# Log Sifter

WIP - a script written in ruby to allow parsing of logs

To run:
```
ruby -r "./log_sifter.rb" -e "LogSifter.new('test')"
```

Replace 'test' with desired logfile

#### todo
* determine what information is needed from each logfile.
* test logfiles from many different apps
* refactor to take out unecessary files
* create an executable
* create this as a gem
